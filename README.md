For a smooth execution, start by placing the designated folder in the htdocs directory, which can typically be found in your MAMP/XAMPP/WAMP server installation. Then, open MAMP and access it through your web browser. Navigate to "my website" where you will see the folder. Click on it to open the front end of the website. Proceed by filling out the form and submitting it. After that, you can access MAMP's localhost (http://localhost:8888/phpMyAdmin5/index.phproute=/sql&pos=0&db=login&table=registration) or, within MAMP's interface, locate the tools section. In the tools section, access phpMyAdmin, then your database, and browse through it to find the stored data.
